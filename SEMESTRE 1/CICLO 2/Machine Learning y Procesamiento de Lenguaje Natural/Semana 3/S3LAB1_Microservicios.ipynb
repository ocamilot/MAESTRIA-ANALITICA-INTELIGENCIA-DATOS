    "Este notebook esta compuesto por dos secciones. En la primera secciónn, usted beberá entrenar y guardar (exportar) un modelo de random forest para predecir si una URL es phishing (fraudulenta) o no. En la segunda parte, usará el modelo entrenado y lo disponibilizara usando la libreria *Flask*. En el siguente paper puede conocer más detalles de la base de datos que usaremos y del problema: *A.
